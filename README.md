# MPI-Labview-Library
These are Labview files which pertain to multiple projects from the MGH/MIT group

To use them with the MPS/imager, you must have the following packages downloaded (download with the VI package manager, "VIPM").

* Live HDF5

* OpenG String Library

* OpenG Variant Data Library

* OpenG Error Library

* OpenG Array Library

If you download Live HDF5, it will prompt you to download the others.

On first use with the MPS/imager, you will need to add all of these files to the path (either manually as it prompts you for each, or via preferences). Once you set the path once, ensure you save the file.
